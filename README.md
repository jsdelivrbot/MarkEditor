# MarkEditor

### About

Type your markdown on the left and immediately see the result on the right. You and your friends can edit the same document at the same time if you send them a link (other than the home page).

### Usage

Type anything after the slash in the URL (except for another slash) to visit a unique document and just start creating markdown. An example link would be:
